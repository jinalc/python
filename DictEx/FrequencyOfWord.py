# WAF: frequency_of_words() in a script my_lib.py that takes a string as argument and returns a
# dictionary containing count of each word in the string.
# Ex: a call to function with the argument “count the words in the sentence in”
# the returned dictionary should contain:

import my_lib

print(my_lib.frequency_of_words('this is jinal jinal is silly jinal is clever'))
